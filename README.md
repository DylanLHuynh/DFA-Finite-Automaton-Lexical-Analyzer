# DFA-Finite-Automaton-Lexical-Analyzer

This project implements a deterministic finite automaton (DFA) to perform lexical analysis for a basic arithmetic calculator. The analyzer processes strings representing arithmetic expressions and converts them into a sequence of tokens (e.g., numbers and operators).
